    "When boundary conditions are involved, von Neumann analysis doesn't tell the whole story.  For standard single-step and multi-step methods, we can try to ensure that the values $\\Delta t\\lambda$ lie inside the absolute stability region of the method.  Often, a good first step is to numerically compute the eigenvalues.  Below is a function that builds a finite difference approximation using $2w+1$ values at each point.  In the middle of the domain, the centered difference is used, near the boundaries, the stencils are biased, but still centered as much as possible.\n",
